#Intro about step for Hot & Heavy

Let me introduce about Hot & Heavy.

I have developed this zombie game demo project based on several famous stories.
As you can see on credit , So many stories such as Resident Evil , Final Fantasy , Toon City and etc are used in this game story. I have made main character similar as Cloud Strife so it took 4 days for whole modelling and I used other characters from many unity assets. I could make all assets for game but it could takes a lot of time . And I have designed UI myself from scratch and it took 5 days. So when it comes to UI , I have made it combining several components such as video player , RawImage , Animation , Shader , Visual Effect and other effects include particle effects. And talking about audio assets , I took a lot of time to get audio assets for game so music is very important in games and they can express idea of game or purpose of game so I have worked really hard for using music as background music.
During game development , I haven't any problems so far.
In this game , I added two camera view mode so one is top camera viewer and other one is rotation camera view mode.
In rotation camera view mode , you can rotate camera and view point by dragging screen or drag on mouse right button.
Now I have finished this demo that contains only first mission as zombie game demo.
I used MySQL Database to store user information and 5 videos for UI background movie so I have made this as motion UI that contains animation.
About others , you can see on your pc by playing this demo.
Thank you for reading me.
Enjoy now.
